# IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH SCENES - Just ignore this and name things #
# whatever you want to name them.                                          #
# It's way easier this way. Just ignore it! Works either way.              #

# Clips source list: three methods
#  1. ClipsDirectory. Files in a directory will act as a list of filenames to
#     upload.
#     Example: ClipsDirectory: /clips/
#  2. ClipsList. A path to a textfile of newline-delimited clip numbers, 4-digit
#     zero padded.
#     Example: ClipsList: /resubmit.txt
#  3. ClipsRange. A tuple of numbers that specifies an inclusive range of
#     clip numbers to upload.
#     Example: ClipsRange:
#                 - 35
